This is a repository containing the bin folder i'm using. 

Some stuff is fancy and usefull. Some is just two crap lines used once a year, but it could be still usefull to someone else.

Feel free to upgrade the dev command pretty usefull for oepning and closing workspaces for projects I have. 

## Disclaimer 
- Everything is written using bash because that is what I'm using on all my machines, but feel free to clone and translate into your favorite shell languages. 

- Some tools are used for **42 school** program, like the norm formatter for instance, This tool is not meant to be used during the pool selection, make your own choices but be aware that it is better to learn first.
